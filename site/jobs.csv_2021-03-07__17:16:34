Are you looking for a fun career in software development and knowing that your efforts directly impact the success of the business? Do you want to work in small teams where you are part of the design and direction of the projects? Do you want to work with smart people and grow with the group, sharing your knowledge and learning from others? Do you have a passion for writing code and finding solutions to difficult problems?

At Labatt Food Service we consider ourselves a sophisticated software company that sells food, and our track record speaks for itself. We continue to grow every year and succeed against competitors 50 times our size by being innovators and building long term, respectful relationships with our customers, vendors and employees. Though we are smaller than some larger competitors, we are often first to market with new technologies. Many of our new initiatives eventually become standard across the industry, and we have thus established an unrivaled reputation as being a thought-leader in our industry.

Role & Responsibilities

Labatt’s developers create and continuously improve all the systems that run the business. Software and data analytics play a huge part in the success of the company, and therefore software developers have a significant impact on the company. Since the very beginning, Labatt has focused on writing all of its own code, allowing the company to move quickly into new areas and be flexible to customer needs. Our team of software developers design, test, and continually re-engineer the critical systems that keep all aspects of the business running at full steam. Developers work as members of small teams, and employ Agile methodologies to bring about the internal-efficiency and customer-facing innovations that are necessary to keep our lead in the industry. Our philosophy of investing in clean code and developing people from within allows us to build for the long term and leverage the most forward-thinking APIs, languages, and practices, to take on the most intellectually challenging projects that our industry faces.

As a software developer at Labatt, you will take on projects approximately 6 months in length, iterate on a small team of 3-5, test thoroughly, design clean & modular code, experiment, learn, be challenged, and serve the needs of the business. All developers are expected to contribute to the team's success by solving non-trivial problems and sharing lessons learned with the group. Developers are also expected to follow the group's established coding and process best practices as established by the group to ensure quality and consistent code - code that will last for many years. That said, developers have a significant amount of freedom over their projects and the ability to experiment with newer technologies and practices that may help the group overall.

About Labatt Food Service:
Labatt Food Service, founded in 1968 and headquartered in San Antonio, Texas is a privately owned company and the tenth largest foodservice distributor in the nation, servicing food-away-from-home customers in five states. The company currently has over 1600 employees and over 6000 customers, including school districts, military bases, restaurant chains, convenience store chains, and individual outlets. Over the 50+ years Labatt has existed as a B2B food distribution and logistics company, sales have grown from $8 million to over $1.3B annually and we expect to continue to grow each year.

Our Current Stack

Developers at Labatt Food Service use a variety of technologies, including:

C#, Visual Basic, Golang, IBM RPG, Vue.js, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Docker, and SQL.

Requirements

The developers who do best at Labatt must have the ability to think both strategically and tactically, the discipline to set and hit deadlines, an appetite for hard work and continuous personal improvement, a passion for working and effectively communicating with others, and a commitment to the success of the overall organization.

Proficiency in coding and the ability to write clean, functional code is a must, although we train everyone to our particular style and needs. We understand that developers learn and use different technologies over time. We are more interested in finding developers who can think and write code and are less interested in ""X years with Y technology"". No matter the starting skill level, developers are expected to improve over time.

A bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field is required.

Entry level developers work in teams with more experienced developers and are expected to contribute to user stories as well as the implementation and design of the software projects.

What the Security Customer Experience Organization Does
Cisco Security Customer Experience (CX) organization supports customers through the entire lifecycle of a security solution: from understanding business needs to deploying custom solutions, from optimizing existing solutions to developing applications that meets specific needs; from helping customers to maintain their solutions to helping them investigate potential security incidents. In order to effectively support customers offering specialized services with specialized consultants, Security CX is segmented in four areas: Security Consulting Services, Assessment and Penetration Services, Cisco Talos Incident Response Services (CTIR) and Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) Services.

Security Consulting Services *

Our Security Consulting Services Team is distributed across the US. We provide security professionals that can assist our customers with their security challenges, irrespective of the security products they have in their environment (Cisco, or otherwise). Additionally, we offer strategic consulting, aligned with Cisco’s product offerings, to help customers with business case development and product adoption. Our focus in Security Consulting is to help our customers get better at securing their organization and integrating security into their business needs.


Our Security Consultants help our customers understand complex security needs by identifying challenges, risks and vulnerabilities in technology, people, and processes. We achieve this through understanding business objectives and how those objectives influence security decisions, developing strategies and roadmaps to address these requirements and providing support to existing programs and projects.
Engagements include security program building, developing layered security models, compliance assessments (against various compliance frameworks), implementation planning, design and execution.
Consulting Services is also focused on assisting our clients to use and get the most value from their Cisco security products. We advise our customers to adopt and utilize best in breed Cisco security technologies, using tried and true methodologies for deployment and migration.
We focus on aligning our technologies, or mix of technologies, to accomplish our customer’s business goal through a consultative approach. We believe that no one knows Cisco products better than our own Cisco resources. Our customers feel the same way.
A sample of the products that our Consulting Services team works with are: Advance Malware Protection (AMP) for networks and endpoints, Firepower next-generation firewalls, Identity Services Engine (ISE) - network access and authentication / virtual segmentation, Stealthwatch - network visibility and protection, Email Security Appliances (ESA) and Web Security Appliances (WSA). You'll have the opportunity to work directly with a mentor to learn and take part in customer interactions and projects, helping you better understand our business and shape your skills.
Engagements include building, deploying and optimizing Cisco Security solutions like FirePower, Identity Services Engine, Trustsec and others. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/index.html
Assessment and Penetration Team (APT) *

This group is primarily based out of our downtown Chicago, IL office, but with security professionals throughout the US. Consultants in APT Services help our clients address their complex security problems while using our expert knowledge, mature methodologies, and advanced research capabilities. APT takes a technical approach in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities and threats by emulating real-world attack techniques through red team and social engineering assessments, reverse engineering, application assessment and Secure DevOps reviews, as well as hardware security (including IoT and Connected Car).

Cisco Talos Incident Response Services *

The Cisco Talos Incident Response (IR) Service significantly strengthens a customer’s network and information security resiliency. CTIR leverages Cisco’s Talos Threat Intelligence tools and capabilities along with industry leading tools and processes to assist our customers with responding to incidents as they occur. CTIR also works with our customers to proactively improve their capabilities to detect, manage, and respond to incidents quickly and effectively. Using the latest intelligence and standard methodologies, it introduces a process that engages all layers of defense and provides a comprehensive range of capabilities to help organizations prepare, maintain, respond to, and recover from incidents efficiently. If emergency assistance is required, our responders are available within hours for rapid investigation and mitigation of threats virtually and in-person.

Security Orchestration, Automation and Response Services *

Security Orchestration is a group of software engineers whose mission is to automate security processes and orchestrate disparate security technologies into holistic solutions that go beyond individual product capabilities. We do this with Cisco and 3rd party products, using any platform to build software-engineered workflows and capabilities. In the course of our work, we regularly touch all the products within our Security portfolio. Concretely, most of our solutions are desktop utilities, portals, integrations, and automate security tasks written in Java (and a few in Python, C#, and Golang) using standard software engineering methodologies such as Agile and Secure Development Life Cycle.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.)

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

The Team You’ll Work With

You will be joining our newest vertical at Carta called CartaX. The CartaX team is creating more owners by removing restrictions on when and how employees exercise equity. Our team is building a private stock market that will allow the trading of shares in return for liquidity for employees of pre-IPO companies. CartaX will be the world’s first vertically integrated financial marketplace for private securities.

As manager for the CartaX SRE team you'll be responsible for building and operating distributed systems that underpin our liquidity offerings. These are financial systems that require careful thought and planning around resiliency, security, and operability. You will manage a team responsible for building and running the backend services and infrastructure supporting features such as order management and handling, market access, matching engines, and post-trade.

The Problems You’ll Solve

The CartaX SRE team ensures we have a process and systems in place to support infrastructure that is resilient, scalable, and secure as we continue to scale existing products and host new products as they are produced.

Some of the problems you’ll help us solve are:

Hosting our distributed systems, containerization, “infrastructure as code” problems, and our overall developer operations problems..
Ensure that CartaX products stay live, work, and are fixed quickly and effectively while also setting up systems to expedite production time.
Consult on the fundamentals of building reliable distributed systems
How to architect and deploy the core services and building blocks ( AWS infra, CI/CD, Security, o11y ) for yourself and product teams to rapidly test out new ideas and operate solid features.
About You

You have experience in a management role leading teams of engineers. You have experience working closely with product teams through every phase of the product life cycle - design, build, operation. You have experience with hosting distributed systems on a cloud provider (specifically, Google Cloud Platform or AWS) with an “infrastructure as code” mindset (using tools like Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc). You have experience building and operating distributed systems with a focus on security design and implementation. You have some experience with compiled languages such as Java/Kotlin, Golang and experience with containerization (specifically, Docker and Kubernetes).

Most importantly you're excited to work on a product that will fundamentally change the way private companies view liquidity, going public and how employees exercise their options.

We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, connect with us via email at recruiting@carta.com. As a company, we value fairness, helpfulness, transparency, leadership and build our teams around these values.

Hack the Full Stack

Philo's engineers hack up and down the technology stack. It's not uncommon for a Philo engineer to go from backend coding to user experience design, from the video encoding pipeline to system scalability, from site maintenance to iOS/Android development. Philo engineers own what they build from start to finish. We ship to production multiple times per day and keep unnecessary process to a minimum so we can maintain our pace of rapid development.

We are actively hiring engineers who are looking to build a completely new kind of product and who have a passion for back-end and/or front-end development.

Infrastructure

Philo's infrastructure consists of thousands of connected machines in nearly 100 data-centers across the country, with new machines spinning up every week. Philo is harnessing petabyte storage and petaflop compute power in a highly distributed environment. Our systems ingest roughly 50Gb of video per second, then transcode, segment, and encrypt it to deliver live television to our users. Meanwhile, our DVR storage system writes millions of episodes to disk every day. We operate in two different environments: on commercial cloud infrastructure, as well as within the unpredictable world of remotely managed hardware in a wide variety of hosting environments across the country.

As a backend engineer you will be responsible for:

Brainstorming, designing, implementing, and rolling out the next generation of Philo's system to handle an order of magnitude more channels, users, and recordings.
Developing our video pipeline: building a highly available transcoding, segmentation, and video hosting and storage system.
Automating system configuration: since we're a small team, constantly deploying both new hardware systems and code in cloud infrastructure, we have no choice but to heavily automate our infrastructure.
Hacking on our monitoring and management system: we graph, track, and alert on all kinds of metrics up and down our stack, giving us important insight into performance trends and helping us catch issues before they impact our users.
Finding cheaper, faster, better solutions: both in our cloud environment and our hardware-based systems, we're always trying to reduce costs and improve our product.

We are language agnostic, but most of our server-side code is written in Golang, Node, and Ruby, with some C++ and Python. Our centralized infrastructure is built out on Kubernetes, and we practice continuous deployment across all of our systems.

Status: Full-time
Location: San Francisco, CA
Compensation: Includes competitive salary, company stock options and health benefits.

We value a diverse and inclusive workplace and we welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, skills, and perspectives. Philo is an equal opportunity employer.

Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. We also support materializing massive retroactive datasets into our customers' cloud data warehouses. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.

Under the hood, Heap is powered by Node.js, React, TypeScript, Golang, Scala, Spark, Kafka, Redis, and PostgreSQL (using CitusDB), plus Objective-C, Swift, Java, and Kotlin SDKs. For more about our architecture, check out Virtual Events: Making Data-Driven Decisions a Reality.

What we're looking for

We aren't expecting you to know everything! One of our core values is ""Emphasize Slope Over Y-Intercept,"" so we are always looking for candidates eager to learn new technologies.

A collaborative and intellectually curious approach to software development. You enjoy learning from and teaching others, and aren't afraid of asking lots of questions.

Excellent communication skills, particularly in writing. We're a distributed team all over the world, so we pride ourselves on our ability to communicate complex ideas clearly in writing across the team.

For more senior engineers, a track record of leading projects to success, and a passion for leading by example, mentoring others, and sharing your expertise with the rest of the team.

For our product engineering teams, experience across the stack with any modern web framework. Familiarity with parts of our stack is a plus (React, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL)

For our Capture SDK teams, deep knowledge of application runtimes like HTML/DOM, UIKit, ReactNative, Android, or iOS.

For our platform engineering teams, backend server and database experience. Familiarity with parts of our stack is a plus (Node.js, Golang, Scala, Spark, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL).

People are what make Heap awesome. Regardless of age, education, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or any personal characteristics, we want everyone to feel welcome. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive equal opportunity workplace everyone can call home.

Heap has raised $95M in funding from NEA, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, SVAngel, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, Ram Shriram, and others. We offer plenty of awesome benefits, and we were named #1 on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work (SMB). We'd love to hear from you!"

You will work cross functionally with the Customer Experience and IT organizations, playing a role in transforming Cisco by developing and implementing programs critical for Cisco Customers.

CX IP Engineering digital expertise makes us uniquely qualified to address the evolving expectations of today’s connected customers and partners, along with Cisco sellers. Using real-time connected data, machine learning, and automation; the team enables Cisco sellers and partners to deliver a powerful, personalized experience—throughout the entire customer lifecycle. CX IP Engineering is focused on providing customers with an immersive digital experience with Cisco. This in turn drives improvements in recurring revenue, cost savings and sales effectiveness for Cisco and its partners.

Is it meaningful to you to work for a company that values employees? Because Cisco expresses employee value by offering benefits like, accrued time off, paid holidays, time to give back, 401k matching and many others.
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Write small (1-5 page) documents with simple graphs/flowcharts explaining a problem that needs to be solved, the proposed solution, and alternative solutions

Give technical demos of your work to your friendly peers

Meet with fellow engineers and discuss technical challenges, and write down their requirements

Self-manage a small TODO list

Qualifications:

The type of person who will succeed in this role will have demonstrated their skills with previous projects in most of these domains, but an ability to learn and grow can offset a lack of experience in a specific area.

Kubernetes (bonus points for specific Azure Kubernetes Service or VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition experience)

Pod resource management

Secrets management

Deployments (rolling updates, rollbacks)

Good usage of labels, selectors, and annotations

Basics of monitoring & observability

Declarative K8 configuration (Helm, Kustomize, K8 Manifests/Templating)

Service meshes

GitOps concepts & continuous deployment tools (ArgoCD)

Imperative languages (Golang, Java, C++, etc.) including dependency management, build processes

Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager)

Shell scripting

Basics of operating systems (filesystem permissions, processes)

Basics of networking (OSI networking model, firewalls, proxies, load balancing)

Our benefits

To help you stay energized, engaged and inspired, we offer a wide range of benefits including a strong retirement plan, tuition reimbursement, comprehensive healthcare, support for working parents and Flexible Time Off (FTO) so you can relax, recharge and be there for the people you care about.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

About us

We started Vanta in 2017 as Equifax had lost every American's social security number, Home Depot had leaked its customers' credit card numbers to hackers, and Facebook admitted that it irresponsibly sent user data to third parties who tried to influence the US election. It was clear that security and privacy had become mainstream issues, and that we all increasingly relied on cloud services to store everything from our personal photos to our communications at work.

Vanta's mission is to be the layer of trust on top of these services, and to secure the internet, increase trust in software companies, and keep consumer data safe.

We do this by building an automated head of security for technology companies, and we use that system to both help a company secure itself and to prove their security to others.

If we succeed in our mission, it should feel irresponsible for users to put data into a product that isn't certified by Vanta, and irresponsible for companies to collect data without using Vanta to secure and monitor themselves."

As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, from the Linux kernel up through Ubuntu server, desktop, IoT and operations tooling, from the public cloud to the edge, both open source products and internal commercial business systems. We work in low-level engineering with kernels and compilers and toolchains, we work with web technology, and many layers in between.

Our engineering directors run products which are too large for a single team. Great directors of engineering work at a higher level, ensuring productivity and satisfaction for the whole team, and coordinating across the company. We require extensive engineering experience in director appointments so that decisions and work can be assessed at a technical level, but the mission of a director is to build and develop a group that is highly effective at every level.

At the scale at which engineering directors work, we expect them to be accountable for the rounded results of their team - not just code, but engagement with the open source community, documentation, quality and product performance and efficiency.

Applications to this Fast Track queue are reviewed by a senior team at Canonical for Software Engineering Director placements across the company. Successful candidates will be offered a set of engineering director opportunities matched to their strengths and interests to start their career at Canonical.

You are an exceptional Software Engineering Director candidate

You have proven outstanding at maths and sciences, have built high quality software, gained software engineering management experience and are now looking for a challenging engineering director role with a company that makes critical products for the global market.

You also believe you have excellent judgement about people - their motivations, abilities, developmental needs and prospects for success.

Your technology interests may include cloud computing, IoT, or Linux itself. You have a gift for software design and implementation, and enjoy contributing to a highly professional environment with careful choices of technology, architecture, data design, and user interface. You have broad-based knowledge of Linux, networking, software development, databases, API design and possibly web presentation layers.

You are familiar with the open source environment, and want to build products in partnership with a community.

You can demonstrate insight into performance and quality engineering practices, and you have helped teams embrace effective disciplines on both fronts. You also have an understanding of security practices and principles and the impact that engineering choices have on product security.

You have experience producing well-documented products and working with design professionals to shape the product. You have clearly articulated views on the ways engineering practices influence product outcomes, not just technically but in open source communities and in the marketplace.

You have deep experience with either or both Python and Golang. You may also have front-end web engineering experience, or deep Linux kernel or operating system experience.

It is an advantage to be able to point to open source work of your own which demonstrates these strengths.

This is a role for leadership, management, organization, architecture, design and mentorship, not individual contribution through coding. You should relish the opportunity to shape and direct and develop an engineering team that is happy and brilliant, and produces a product that will be a pleasure to use and to evolve.

We are hiring engineering leadership in the following areas:

Cloud native development and operations (Docker, Kubernetes, CAAS, PAAS)
Internet of things technologies and capabilities
Containerisation and virtualization technologies
Devsecops tooling, practices and services
Commercial business systems for Canonical itself
Data applications from SQL databases to big data
AI/ML ops and technologies
Robotics and embedded Linux in a wide variety of industries
Security offerings, practices and services
Storage from raw disk to filesystem to network service
Networking from bare metal to SDN and overlays
Distributed systems design and implementation
Linux, the kernel and Ubuntu itself
Desktop Linux and desktop applications on Windows and macOS
Open source community collaboration

This is a director-level role, but we expect directors of engineering to have delivered successful software projects in their own right during their career. In applying for this role you will need to demonstrate both exceptional technical skill, broad based knowledge of the modern open source software arena, proven mathematics or engineering ability, and the ability to articulate ideas and motivate others to embrace your thinking.

We love our values

We're building a fam, our chosen circle, around a set of values that guide how we work and interact with the world around us. Our cultural norms at work can't be turned off when the computer's away - we live these in every part of our lives. Our team isn't for everyone, so if you're right for it, the following values should resonate strongly with how you live your life.

We're intolerant to bad vibes, and genuinely love where we work (and want to keep it that way). We choose our fam by looking beyond a skillset - because roles can change - and surround ourselves with folks we want to spend our lives with.

We aim high and hire smart people to get there - folks that use logic and critical thinking to make the best decisions. We look beyond the problem and quickly build context to come to the right solution; our ever-changing and high-pace environment requires a team of great autonomous thinkers.

When we say ""got it,"" our team knows we're owning it, we're following through, and we'll deliver beyond expectations. Put the effort into figuring things out yourself (hey, we're all busy), and actively collaborate if you haven't Got it; ownership also means knowing when to seek help and to never suffer in silence.

We're a rare team of folks that genuinely love to work hard because we know that putting in the effort gets the win - we're the people that started our careers at the lemonade stand. Not at all costs, but we give it our all because our customers are hustling to grow their businesses, and the hustle's more fun when we're winning together.

We collaborate for more than the high-fives (although they're pretty great), and our team thrives on timely and direct feedback. There's no hesitation in being direct; since we're surrounded by smart people, we embrace thoughtful and challenging perspectives.

The Cato Institute is a public policy research organization—a think tank—dedicated to the principles of individual liberty, limited government, free markets and peace. Its scholars and analysts conduct independent, nonpartisan research on a wide range of policy issues.
Founded in 1977, Cato owes its name to Cato’s Letters, a series of essays published in 18th- century England that presented a vision of society free from excessive government power. Those essays inspired the architects of the American Revolution. And the simple, timeless principles of that revolution — individual liberty, limited government, and free markets – turn out to be even more powerful in today’s world of global markets and unprecedented access to information than Jefferson or Madison could have imagined. Social and economic freedom is not just the best policy for a free people, it is the indispensable framework for the future. Cato Institute is an EOE.
The Cato Institute is seeking a quantitative Research Associate to join a growing and effective team of data-driven researchers working on immigration policy. The Research Associate will be responsible for using modern statistical methods to support the work of Cato’s immigration team in producing original empirical research.

Support the research of the senior members of the immigration team (80-90%) as well as other departments on an as needed basis (10-20%). Roughly half of the Research Associate’s work will be for short term day-to-day projects, the other half will be for long term projects.
Replicate statistical findings from peer-reviewed academic research, policy analyses, and government reports.
Gather, clean, and format datasets.
Help prepare presentable statistical output in the form of figures and tables for other members of the Cato team.
Occasionally co-author policy analyses, working papers, peer-reviewed academic papers, blog posts, and other empirical work with members of the Cato immigration team.

You should be able to apply a breadth of tools, data sources and analytical techniques to answer a wide range of high-impact business questions and present the insights in concise and effective manner. Additionally, you should be an effective communicator capable of independently driving issues to resolution and communicating insights to non-technical audiences.

This is a high visibility role with heavy interaction with senior leadership. Analytical ingenuity and leadership, coupled with demonstrated cross-functional partnership, are critical skills for this role.

The ideal candidate would have several years of experience working in open source web frameworks. They would also be eager to learn, grow, and foster healthy working relationships.
If you have experience building production web applications and are as passionate about helping customers as you are about working with new technologies, then we want to talk!
Skills & Requirements
Do you love to work directly with customers to solve business problems?
We believe great software is discovered by understanding the core problems our clients are facing – and that is best achieved through frequent and direct communication with the subject matter experts. We provide leadership to support and guide interactions, but we need you to be comfortable talking with clients, discussing problems, and proposing solutions, which may not always be more software.
Do you have experience writing production web applications?
We strive to support our team’s growth, learning, and taking on new roles at the edge of our comfort zones. At the same time, our clients expect us to bring a certain level of expertise. If you have never worked on a production web application, it is unlikely you will succeed here, even if you have other types of engineering experience.
Are you able to work remotely, within +/- 2 hours of US Eastern time zone?
We all mostly work from home. This requires the ability to self-direct and communicate well in writing. It also offers tremendous freedom and power, which comes with, uh, tremendous responsibility. We currently require our team to be within a 2hr time zone difference of Richmond, VA and physically based in the United States.
Bonus Points
Being within easy driving distance of Richmond or Charlottesville is a huge plus!

What We Offer
A Great Team – Our team of engineers and designers is the best part of working here. We only hire people who are fantastic teammates – competent and smart, sure, but also humble, positive, and generous.
Great Clients – We work with mostly small and medium clients, for whom our projects make a huge impact. We prioritize clients who are pleasant and good to work with, people who share our values of transparency and empathy.
Work From Home – We are a distributed company. Everyone works from home, though the leadership team all live in central Virginia.
Negligible Travel – In general, we don’t travel routinely for projects. If this is a specific concern, we’re happy to discuss.
Flexible Work Schedule – We require a certain amount of overlap with the rest of the team, but if you have a predictable schedule, we can probably support it, e.g., ending at 3:30 every day or being out every Friday morning.
Good Work Life Balance (really) – We ask our team to work 40 hours a week*. That’s all: a good, productive 40 hours. And then we try our best to leave you alone off the clock. We do this in part because that’s how we want to live but also because we want our team to be recharged and ready to do their best when working. *If you need to work fewer than 40 hours, that might be possible too; let’s talk.
Competitive Compensation – We offer highly competitive salary and benefits, including generous time off, 401k, FSA, medical and dental insurance."

Amazon is all in on games.
Do you want the chance to solve a real world business challenge? Are you fascinated with connecting players with games they will enjoy? Do you possess strong analytical, design, and problem solving skills? Do you enjoy working with data, algorithms, and gamers? If you are not afraid of ambiguity, thinking outside the box, or complex challenges, this might be the internship for you.

We believe the evolution that began with pre-internet arcade communities a quarter at a time, growing to the live streams and eSports of today, will continue to a future in which fans are creators, players are celebrities, and games are a global cultural touchstone that cuts across age, gender and nationality. Games have the power to connect communities at a massive scale, and we want to be a part of that future by delivering great customer experiences to players, viewers, streamers, and game developers. If you share our belief that games will produce some of the future’s most influential voices in media and art, come join us.

No matter the location of your internship, we give you the tools to own your summer and learn in a real world setting.

If this excites you, come build the future with us.

Description
Blackthorn is looking for an excellent full stack (largely backend) developer. You've likely contributed to open source projects.
The position requires above average attention to details, concern for the exact correctness of work, and a strong commitment to tasks completed on time. You will take work seriously, have a strong sense of duty, and discipline. A somewhat faster-than-average pace will be the norm for this position. Detailed, specialized work is the major focus.
The position will provide security in a stable work environment, allowing you to plan for, focus on and complete tasks on hand. When changes in the nature of the work occur, you will receive direction, training and support. The position will generally be task oriented, requiring you to have a conservative, careful, and cautious approach to work.
You're a tinkerer. You're a specialist. You don't classify yourself as an expert in any one language. You have a personal, public repo of projects you've tested just because you enjoy it. You prefer writing code 90% of your day. You'll make magic happen with our Events app (https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000EX3qVUAT).
You're someone who'll try to do something even if it doesn't make sense all for the sake of seeing if it breaks something.
Why is our work important
Our apps provide our customers what they're looking for with Events and Payments without being hard to set up. Most apps in our space take weeks to implement. Our apps take hours and they work more flexibly, achieving significantly more functionality than our competitors'.

Trajectory
IC (individual Contributor) or Management. We're at the precipice of the classic SaaS hockey stick growth chart and are now starting to scale, so those who produce will be able to define their own path. We deliver a bigger scope of your responsibilities than larger companies and your impact will be directly quantifiable to the success of the company and our customers.

Onboarding Process
You'll work with our internal teams to learn our stack and vision over the course of many months, but you will be expected to begin contributing within a few days.

What the job will bring you
A deep sense of satisfaction. A chance to continuously learn, be challenged, and deliver functionality to customers who crave it. Generally speaking, we deliver what's most popularly requested to fill needs not filled by other apps in the marketplace, in a way that we think will provide the best UX. And we love our team. Meaningful work and meaningful relationship is why we are here.

Ideally: You've contributed to open source projects. Either multiple commits to the same project or contributed across multiple projects.
Across any of the following:
API buildingMEAN stack developmentLibraries

Personal Requirements
Excellent English written and oral communication
Detailed and organized, Self-learner
Happy working from home in a fast-paced environment
Keen eye for detail and a commitment to excellence with good intuition
Be willing to help your teammates, share your knowledge with them, and learn from them
Be open to receiving constructive feedback and turning it into process improvements

We’re a small group (2 Engineers, including CTO), so we’re looking for someone who can be a leader within the team and help…",19 days ago,"About LegUp Every year, millions of families are forced to make career sacrifices or leave the workforce altogether because of inaccessibility to child care. COVID has made these numbers even worse.Finding child care is tough, but many parents don't realize it until it's too late. Families will spend weeks looking for the right programs for their families, then sit on waitlists for an average of 18 months.Why? Because child care providers, primarily women and PoC business owners, are so busy caring and educating children, it's hard for them to manage operations at the same time. So we built technology to help make the child care enrollment process easier, keep families in the workforce, and keep small business owners in business.We're a team of parents, child care advocates, technologists, and doers who are passionate about creating a better child care search and enrollment process — and we're looking for people to join our mission.ABOUT THE ROLEAt LegUp, we're building a SaaS-enabled marketplace that helps child care programs and parents connect in a seamless way. We recently launched our platform, and providers are ecstatic about the ease of use it brings to their operations. We have a backlog of providers ready to sign up, and are hiring to help take our solution to the next level.We’re looking for a senior full-stack engineer to join our team. We’re a small group (2 Engineers, including CTO), so we’re looking for someone who can be a leader within the team and help with all pieces of the equation. From front-end work to back-end database changes. CSS changes to meet design guidelines to code to manage our workflow processes. Admin tool work to partner integrations.We need a rare breed who is a doer and a leader. Someone who is ready to dive in and code, able to learn and adopt new technology in a self-paced manner, and is comfortable with ambiguity and the fast-paced world of startups. Someone who wants to roll up their sleeves and solve any problem that comes their way, but can also work with more junior engineers to guide them in helping with pieces of larger projects. We want someone who has high standards of coding quality and integrity, but at the same time is passionate about our business and our mission and wants to build what’s right for working families and care providers.As for the technology stack; we’re building in AWS leveraging Aurora Postgres, API Gateway backed Lambda functions (primarily written in Node.js), and Next React-Redux with Material UI on the front end.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Is your happy place making web pages look amazing? Fine-tuning CSS to look its best on every device and browser? Exploring the latest tricks with CSS grid and watching videos and taking courses to continuously polish your front-end skills? Trying out different JavaScript frameworks and forming opinions on which ones work best for different projects?
If so, we’d love to talk to you about developing new sites to help people invest their hard-earned cash more effectively and profitably.
Our purpose at The Motley Fool is to help people get Smarter, Happier, and Richer. We educate people on everything from how to choose the best credit card, to how to make the most of their 401(k). The Economist has called The Motley Fool “an ethical oasis” within the financial industry, and we are looking to expand our unique brand of advice to even more kinds of financial conundrums.
With an online presence reaching way back into the early days of America Online in the nineties, we live and breathe online, and we are always trying to up our website game. We are looking for people with solid hands-on work experience building beautiful, fast, and functional websites. We are a motley crew, and each of us chooses a ‘motley’ phrase that describes the unique perspective we bring to the Fool. We love people with opinions formed from broad experience that have the talent to remix them with others in awesome ways.
Although The Motley Fool is a well-established company, we regularly form small startup teams to build new products independently from the ground up. These teams get lots of love and resources from the mothership, but the freedom to build like mad.
We’d love to work with you if:
You solve problems: You spot issues and inefficiencies from a mile away and aren’t afraid to suggest solutions and then dive in to implement them. You know when to go looking for input from others, and are constantly looking for ways to improve our code, processes, and people.
You pay attention to detail: Missed details erode accountability, and that hurts when customers are trusting us to manage and invest their hard-earned savings. You actively pull in other team members to review your code and understand the value of testing when necessary.
You’re curious and love to learn: Whether it’s the latest technology, how the Foolish business operates, or investing; you have an insatiable appetite for knowledge. And, you love to share with your fellow Fools – dropping links in Slack is like breathing for you.
You take pride in your work: The thought of a customer seeing a 500 error page keeps you up at night. When a member cancels, it brings a tear to your eye. You want to ensure that every customer has a great experience with The Motley Fool because of what you build.
Requirements:
You’re an entrepreneurial self-starter who is comfortable moving quickly in a small startup environment.
Serious front-end development experience, and love of CSS and JavaScript.
Experience building responsive web experiences on high traffic websites.
Online portfolio that showcases your talent.
True desire to work on a team, and pitch in to help that team succeed.
Additional nice to haves:
Wordpress
Vue.js
Django
WCAG AA 2.0
Sounds like you? Awesome! We might have a bright future together – so go ahead and apply now!

How to Apply

To apply, please email [email protected]. Use the subject line ""Not a squid"" and tell us why you are a digital octopus.

We’re looking for a multi-talented, many-hat-wearing digital octopus* to help us build incredible websites (and lots of other things) for our clients, to make a positive impact on the world.

A Bit About Us

We’re a digital marketing agency that works exclusively with organizations who have a purpose beyond profit. We use the web to make the world a better place.

We’re a tight-knit team, and everyone works remotely. Our team is spread across the United States, in Europe, South America, and Asia. We value an ownership mentality, we’ve got each other’s backs, and we pride ourselves on our company culture. We don’t micromanage, and we’re always looking for ways to do things better.

But enough about us, let’s talk about you!

Role Overview

You’ll be working mostly in WordPress, and mostly creating websites and web apps. Sometimes you’ll design, sometimes you’ll develop (front-end), sometimes you’ll do both. You should be comfortable with everything that falls under that umbrella: Wireframes, design mockups, writing code, creating custom post types, configuring page builders, capturing dark wizards, launching sites, and all the odds and ends that come in between.

You’ll interact everyday with our project managers, strategists, other designers, developers, and anyone else involved in bringing an idea to life. You’ll almost always be working on at least a few projects at once, sometimes in different capacities.

We promise to itch both sides of your brain.

Possess (these traits) for Success

While this list isn’t entirely comprehensive, these things are pretty important to us.

You should know WordPress like the back of your hand. And the front of your hand. And the gap between your fingers.
An excellent eye for visual design, and a great instinct for UI and UX best practices
Experience designing responsive websites using industry-standard design tools (Figma, Sketch, XD, etc.)
Strong knowledge of HTML & CSS, and best practices
Working knowledge of PHP, Javascript, particularly as it pertains to WordPress
Familiarity with responsive frameworks, like Bootstrap
Experience working with popular WordPress page builders, particularly Beaver Builder and Elementor
Bonus: Experience with other content management systems, Javascript frameworks, gremlins, app design

This isn’t a junior position. We need someone who knows what they’re doing, is able to work independently, take responsibility, and solve problems (even super weird ones). In terms of years of experience, we’re looking for more than 5, but less than 500. Even better if at least some of those years were at an agency, or running your own freelance business.

Benefits of Working With Us

A flexible work schedule. Unlimited vacation. Competitive pay. Participation in our annual shutdown (two weeks off, sometimes more, at the end of the year). Also, we celebrate major holidays by not working. Most importantly, you’ll be working on projects that really matter.

We welcome applicants from around the world, but you have to be willing to work hours that have at least a partial overlap with normal business hours in at least one of the US time zones.

Please include a link to your portfolio with your application.

We’re based in Little Rock, Arkansas, but are a fully distributed team. Our bread and butter is WordPress-based website design and dev that places a high value on progressive UI/UX design, high-attention-to-detail front-end development, and thoughtful, user-friendly custom admins. In addition to websites, we do everything from UI/UX design, web apps, brand and identity design, and custom development solutions. We’re fortunate to work with some really great clients that range from startups to mom-and-pop shops to large companies to financial institutions to nonprofits.Current status:  All the clients want all the things over the past handful of months, so we’ve experienced some serious growing pains and have been stretched super thin.That’s where you come in.Who, What, WhyWe’re currently a two-person shop, so you’d be a very important piece of our team. Some quick chicken scratch math says you’d be an entire 1/3 of our team, so you’d be an important and valued part of what we do here at Perch.Because we’re a small team, we all do a little bit of everything and are looking for someone with either experience in a wide range of development or someone who is eager and quick to learn. Here’s the thing — we aren’t necessarily chasing a unicorn or some kind of mythical creature or a jack of all trades, but we need someone who wants to jump in and play a big role in creating great work - whatever that looks like.We're looking for a developer who has experience with (custom) WordPress and has some solid front-end chops. In an ideal scenario, you’d be able to be handed mockups and see them through to a fully-realized, custom-built WordPress site. Or you might be given a task list of new features or technical debt for a client site and be expected to complete those items. Or you might be asked to step in during QA and make the final tweaks to a site pre-delivery.

Joining our team means that you’ll be valued and respected and listened to and your work will be appreciated.Our perks are largely people- and culture-centric. We value time off and work-life balance and mental health and growing professionally and feeling appreciated. So whereas we offer fair compensation, we doubt you’re gonna be making it rain in the club. What we lack in providing all your spare kindling money, we make up for with a great company culture that includes some nice perks.

Those things are challenging for small shops like us [though we regularly explore our options]. BUT…we think some of the other perks we offer help to sweeten the deal.)Ok great, so what does it pay?Labels are tricky. Things like “junior” or “full stack” or “lead” or whatever have a whole range of different meanings to people and with those definitions come a very, very wide range of salary expectations.This position is somewhere in that sweet spot right in between what we think is generally viewed as junior and senior. If you have 20 years of senior-level experience, this probably doesn’t make a ton of sense for you. And if you’re a junior dev who only knows React, this isn’t for you either. We think $50,000/year is a reasonable salary expectation for what our team needs, so hopefully that helps to bring a little clarity of the level we’re looking for.When you Apply This is your opportunity to stand out. Please let us know you care. Finding someone we can relate to and feel good about working alongside makes a huge difference. We’d love our team to become more diverse, so we very much welcome people applying who look and think and have perspectives that are different than us.If that’s you, please submit the following:An introduction to yourself.

The ideal candidate would have several years of experience working on production web applications. They would have a strong desire to straddle our design and engineering teams, providing the glue needed to build beautiful and useful web applications. They would also be eager to learn, grow, and foster healthy working relationships.
If you have experience building production web applications and are as passionate about helping customers as you are about working with new technologies, then we want to talk!

Skills & Requirements

Do you love to work directly with customers to solve business problems?
We believe great software is discovered by understanding the core problems our clients are facing – and that is best achieved through frequent and direct communication with the subject matter experts. We provide leadership to support and guide interactions, but we need you to be comfortable talking with clients, discussing problems, and proposing solutions, which may not always be more software.

Do you have experience creating production web applications?
We strive to support our team’s growth, learning, and taking on new roles at the edge of our comfort zones. At the same time, our clients expect us to bring a certain level of expertise. If you have never worked on a production web application, it is unlikely you will succeed here, even if you have other types of engineering experience.

Extensive production knowledge of HTML/CSS
You’ll be mostly building web applications, so you’ll need to be familiar with your tools, and have used your tools on a number of production web applications.

Experience with Design, UI and, prototyping tools
Comfortable using tools like Sketch, Adobe Suite, inVision, Zeplin, or Figma.

Are you able to work remotely, within +/- 2 hours of US Eastern time zone?
We all mostly work from home. This requires the ability to self-direct and communicate well in writing. It also offers tremendous freedom and power, which comes with, uh, tremendous responsibility. We currently require our team to be within a 2hr time zone difference of Richmond, VA and physically based in the United States. Exceptions can be made if you’re willing to work east coast business hours.
Bonus Points
Being within easy driving distance of Richmond or Charlottesville is a huge plus!
Bonus for having some JavaScript experience, and being able to work within frontend frameworks like React or Vue.
Bonus for having user experience skills.
What We Offer
A Great Team – Our team of engineers and designers is the best part of working here. We only hire people who are fantastic teammates – competent and smart, sure, but also humble, positive, and generous.
Great Clients – We work with mostly small and medium clients, for whom our projects make a huge impact. We prioritize clients who are pleasant and good to work with, people who share our values of transparency and empathy.
Work From Home – We are a distributed company. Everyone works from home, though the leadership team all live in central Virginia.
Negligible Travel – In general, we don’t travel routinely for projects. If this is a specific concern, we’re happy to discuss.
Flexible Work Schedule – We require a certain amount of overlap with the rest of the team, but if you have a predictable schedule, we can probably support it, e.g., ending at 3:30 every day or being out every Friday morning.
Good Work Life Balance (really) – We ask our team to work 40 hours a week*. That’s all: a good, productive 40 hours. And then we try our best to leave you alone off the clock. We do this in part because that’s how we want to live but also because we want our team to be recharged and ready to do their best when working. *If you need to work fewer than 40 hours, that might be possible too; let’s talk.
Competitive Compensation – We offer highly competitive salary and benefits, including generous time off, 401k, FSA, medical and dental insurance."

We offer competitive salaries based on experience and benefits including 401(k), health and life insurance, and long-term disability.

The ideal candidate would have several years of experience working on production web applications. They would have a strong desire to straddle our design and engineering teams, providing the glue needed to build beautiful and useful web applications. They would also be eager to learn, grow, and foster healthy working relationships.
If you have experience building production web applications and are as passionate about helping customers as you are about working with new technologies, then we want to talk!

Skills & Requirements

Do you love to work directly with customers to solve business problems?
We believe great software is discovered by understanding the core problems our clients are facing – and that is best achieved through frequent and direct communication with the subject matter experts. We provide leadership to support and guide interactions, but we need you to be comfortable talking with clients, discussing problems, and proposing solutions, which may not always be more software.

Do you have experience creating production web applications?
We strive to support our team’s growth, learning, and taking on new roles at the edge of our comfort zones. At the same time, our clients expect us to bring a certain level of expertise. If you have never worked on a production web application, it is unlikely you will succeed here, even if you have other types of engineering experience.

Extensive production knowledge of HTML/CSS
You’ll be mostly building web applications, so you’ll need to be familiar with your tools, and have used your tools on a number of production web applications.

Experience with Design, UI and, prototyping tools
Comfortable using tools like Sketch, Adobe Suite, inVision, Zeplin, or Figma.

Are you able to work remotely, within +/- 2 hours of US Eastern time zone?
We all mostly work from home. This requires the ability to self-direct and communicate well in writing. It also offers tremendous freedom and power, which comes with, uh, tremendous responsibility. We currently require our team to be within a 2hr time zone difference of Richmond, VA and physically based in the United States. Exceptions can be made if you’re willing to work east coast business hours.
Bonus Points
Being within easy driving distance of Richmond or Charlottesville is a huge plus!
Bonus for having some JavaScript experience, and being able to work within frontend frameworks like React or Vue.
Bonus for having user experience skills.
What We Offer
A Great Team – Our team of engineers and designers is the best part of working here. We only hire people who are fantastic teammates – competent and smart, sure, but also humble, positive, and generous.
Great Clients – We work with mostly small and medium clients, for whom our projects make a huge impact. We prioritize clients who are pleasant and good to work with, people who share our values of transparency and empathy.
Work From Home – We are a distributed company. Everyone works from home, though the leadership team all live in central Virginia.
Negligible Travel – In general, we don’t travel routinely for projects. If this is a specific concern, we’re happy to discuss.
Flexible Work Schedule – We require a certain amount of overlap with the rest of the team, but if you have a predictable schedule, we can probably support it, e.g., ending at 3:30 every day or being out every Friday morning.
Good Work Life Balance (really) – We ask our team to work 40 hours a week*. That’s all: a good, productive 40 hours. And then we try our best to leave you alone off the clock. We do this in part because that’s how we want to live but also because we want our team to be recharged and ready to do their best when working. *If you need to work fewer than 40 hours, that might be possible too; let’s talk.
Competitive Compensation – We offer highly competitive salary and benefits, including generous time off, 401k, FSA, medical and dental insurance."
